There are three scripts in this directory. The main one is "doorman.rb".
It fetches the current status, loads its previous state, and looks to see
if there's a difference (open->closed, closed->open). If so, it posts a status
update to Twitter.

doorman.sh is a small shell script wrapper that changes directories and manages
a log file.

doorman_auth.rb is used for getting a set of credentials from Twitter.
Start by registering an application with Twitter or retrieving details for an
existing app.
  https://twitter.com/oauth_clients
Then creating a doorman.creds file containting the following:
  {"conumer_key": "<from twitter>", "consumer_secret": "<from twitter>"}
Now you're ready to run doorman_auth.rb . It will give you a URL to go to,
which you should use in a browser where you're logged in as the user you want
doorman.rb to post as. It will wait for you to get a PIN from Twitter, then
spit out a new set of credentials (clean out doorman.creds and paste in the new)
